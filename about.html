        <h1>About ABC Upholstery</h1>
        <h2>A Legacy of Craftsmanship, One Stitch at a Time</h2>
        <p>ABC Upholstery began in 1979 with a single sewing machine, a garage workshop,
         and a deep respect for hands-on craftsmanship. 
         Founded by a skilled upholsterer with a passion for detail and a 
         love for bringing furniture back to life, the business has grown into a trusted local name 
         — built on quality, integrity, and word of mouth.</p>
        <p>For over 46 years, we’ve been serving our community by restoring comfort and 
            character to everything from heirloom chairs to boat cushions and backyard seating. 
            Every project is personal here. Whether we’re reupholstering a 
            family favorite or custom-building something from scratch, we treat each piece 
            like it’s going in our own home.</p>
        <p>What makes us different isn’t just how long we’ve been doing this — 
            it’s how much we still care. Our work is never rushed. We use durable materials, 
            thoughtful techniques, and a steady hand honed through decades of experience. 
            It’s craftsmanship you can sit on — and pass down.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🧵 Tradition – We stick to proven methods while adapting to modern needs</li>
            <li>💬 Communication – Clear services, honest timelines, no surprises</li>
            <li>🪑 Quality – Built to last, from the frame to the final stitch</li>
            <li>🤝 Care – Every customer and every project matters</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Meet the Craftsman</h2>
        <p>Our founder and lead upholsterer has spent over four decades mastering this trade.
             What started as a hobby quickly became a lifelong profession — driven by a belief
              that well-made furniture should last, be loved, and look good doing it.</p>
        <p>Thank you for supporting a small, black owned business.
             We’re proud to serve our neighbors and look forward to helping you bring your
              next project to life.</p>
